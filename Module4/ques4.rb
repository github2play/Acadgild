Write a class that defines the following three methods –
        mean – Calculates the mean of a Set of numbers
        median - The median is the middle value in a set of values. If there are an even number of values,
        it should be the average of the two middle values
        split_into_evenly_sized_subsets – Split the Set into evenly sized subsets
        How would you modify the above class if the values of the Set contain both floats and integers?
